# Employee Payroll Tracking App

## Description

This app is an employee payroll tracking app. So what it does is you can enter in your employee's first name, last name, and their salary for it to be tracked. The interface is really simple to use and you just click the blue button that says " Add Employees" and it will then tell you to enter in all of the information about that employee for it to then be placed in the employee roster section.
